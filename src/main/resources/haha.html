<p><strong>Re: Proclamation of the Ontario Immigration Act</strong></p>

<p>The Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration is pleased to inform you that the Ontario Immigration Act, 2015 and its regulations will be coming into force on January 1, 2018. After seeking input from stakeholders through a series of public consultations held earlier this year, we have formed an Act that supports Ontario’s commitment to creating a fair and diverse society which benefits people across the province.</p>

<p>The Act supports our efforts to attract and retain global talent to promote prosperity and economic growth. The importance of this legislation was underscored by the unanimous support it received from all parties in the Legislature.</p>

<p>You can find the Act and its regulations on the <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/15o08">e-Laws webpage</a>.</p>

<p>Further information about the Act, including what is new and what you need to know as an applicant, an employer, or a representative, will be available in January 2018.</p>

<p>Please monitor the OINP updates page for news, announcements and program information. Stay in touch by visiting our social media pages on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ImmigrantON/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/5505047/">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/ImmigrantON">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p><strong><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">November 22, 2017</span></strong></p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE</strong><br>
<br>
The Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP) has met its 2017 nomination allocation for all streams. &nbsp;If you have submitted a paid application to the OINP, your application will be processed. &nbsp;If your application is approved, the program will nominate you in 2018 and you will be notified at that time. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Please monitor the OINP Updates page for news, announcements and program developments.</p>

<p><span style=" text-decoration: underline;"><strong>November 20, 2017</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>Important Notice: Technical Difficulties with OINP e-Filing Portal</strong></p>

<p>Please be advised that the program experienced technical difficulties with the OINP e-Filing Portal from Thursday evening (November 9) to Sunday November 19. The issue has now been resolved.</p>

<p>In order to account for these technical difficulties, the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP) is granting applicants an additional 10 calendar days to submit their applications through the e-Filing Portal. Expiry dates for Notifications of Interest will also be extended an additional 10 calendar days. &nbsp;</p>

<p>We apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your understanding.</p>

&nbsp;<br>
Please monitor the OINP Updates page for news, announcements and program developments. Any clients whose application deadlines are affected by the system maintenance are asked to contact the program directly at <a href="mailto:ontarionominee@ontario.ca">ontarionominee@ontario.ca</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Re: &nbsp;Ontario’s Express Entry Human Capital Priorities Stream has reached its registration intake limit</strong></p>

<p>Please note that Ontario’s Express Entry Human Capital Priorities Stream has reached the registration intake limit. No additional registrations for this stream can be accepted.</p>

<p>The OINP is monitoring the intake of applications with respect to the limits of Ontario’s federal nomination allocation, and will determine if any more applications can be accepted for this stream.</p>

<p>Please monitor this OINP Updates page for news, announcements and program developments.</p>

<p>Please visit our <a href="http://www.ontarioimmigration.ca/en/pnp/OI_PNPQUESTIONS.html">Frequently Asked Questions page</a> for additional information on the OINP.</p>

<p><span style=" text-decoration: underline;"><strong>November 6, 2017</strong></span></p>

<p>On October 24, 2017, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) changed the definition of a dependent child for all immigration programs (including the Provincial Nominee Program). IRCC increased the age limit of a dependent child to “under 22”, raising it from the previous “under 19” requirement.</p>

<p>In all cases, dependents who are 22 years of age or older and who rely on their parents due to a physical or mental health condition will continue to be considered eligible dependents.</p>

<p>All permanent resident applications received by IRCC and all applications submitted to the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP) on October 24, 2017 or later are subject to the new definition.</p>

<p>In addition, to be consistent with the federal government, the OINP will allow applicants who currently have a pending application with the OINP to add a dependent child to their application if they were 19, 20 or 21 years of age on May 3, 2017, or on the date that the program received their application, if between May 3, and today’s date (November 6, 2017).</p>

<p>Note: An application is considered to be ‘pending’ up until a decision is made by the OINP. Once a decision has been rendered, applicants cannot make changes to the application and/or add new dependent family members.</p>

<p>If you have a pending application that was submitted to the OINP between May 3 and November 6, 2017 and you would like to add a dependent child to your application, please send an email to the OINP at <a href="mailto:ontarionominee@ontario.ca">ontarionominee@ontario.ca</a>.</p>

<p>Be sure to quote your file number and include the following information about your dependent child:</p>

<ul>
<li>First and Last Name (Middle Name if applicable),</li>

<li>Date of Birth,</li>

<li>Country of Birth,</li>

<li>Sex,</li>

<li>Citizenship,</li>

<li>Country of Residence,</li>

<li>Copy of the personal details page of their passport.</li>
</ul>

<p>If required for your stream, please verify that you continue to meet the settlement funds requirement based on the number of dependent family members, and submit any additional supporting documents to demonstrate that you have sufficient funds and/or income to cover the settlement costs.</p>

<p>Reminder: Under the federal Provincial Nominee Program, a child’s age is locked in on the date that the application for nomination is made to the province. If the child is eligible at this time, he/she will remain eligible throughout the application process.</p>

<p>In the coming months, the OINP will update all external materials (i.e. application guides, website pages, online applications, etc.) to reflect this change. In the interim, this update serves as notice of the change in definition of a dependent child and is effective immediately.</p>

<p>More information regarding this change to the definition of dependent child is available on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2017/10/new_definition_ofageofdependantsnowinforce.html">IRCC’s website</a>.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>ATTENTION:</strong></p>

<p>The OINP is a very popular program and receives a significant number of applications. The ministry has taken comprehensive measures to help ensure you have a smooth user experience when accessing the OINP e-Filing Portal.</p>

<p>However, you may experience longer than anticipated wait times, as a large number of applicants attempt to access the system at the same time.</p>

<p>To support a smooth user experience, you:</p>

<p>• Should avoid opening multiple tabs or refreshing the page when trying to access the OINP e-filing system.</p>

<p>• Must access the OINP e-Filing Portal through OntarioImmigration.ca. Attempting to directly access the e-Filing Portal through the Government of Ontario’s ONe-key system will cause delays, and could prevent applicants from completing their applications.</p>

<p>You will be queued upon entry to the e-Filing Portal. &nbsp;If you attempt to refresh pages or click on links to other pages once you enter the e-Filing Portal, you will lose your place in the queue. &nbsp;You are encouraged to remain in the queue until the system is ready to proceed.</p>

<p>If you experience technical difficulties with your online application or the OINP e-Filing Portal, visit our <a href="http://www.ontarioimmigration.ca/prodconsum/groups/csc/@oipp/documents/document/oi_en_efiling_010517.pdf">Tip Sheet</a> for solutions. &nbsp;If you are still having difficulties, please contact the OINP directly at: <a href="mailto:OINP.technical-POCI.technique@ontario.ca">OINP.technical-POCI.technique@ontario.ca</a>, and include as much detail as possible. &nbsp;You should include a screen shot and details about how the error occurred. &nbsp;If you have successfully registered for an OINP stream, you should also include your file number for reference.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</strong></p>

<p>This is to inform you about an important OINP update to be announced on <a href="http://www.ontarioimmigration.ca/">www.ontarioimmigration.ca</a> this Thursday, October 12, 2017. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>ABOUT ONTARIO IMMIGRANT NOMINEE PROGRAM (OINP):</strong></p>

<p>The Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP) is an economic immigration program designed to help Ontario meet its labour market and economic development priorities. The program allows Ontario to nominate, for permanent residence, individuals who have the skills and experience to contribute to Ontario’s economy, and assists employers in recruiting and retaining foreign workers.</p>

<p>The OINP is operated by the province of Ontario in partnership with the federal government through Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). The OINP assesses applications and nominates candidates for permanent residence. Individuals nominated by the OINP can then apply for permanent residence through IRCC, IRCC makes the final decision on each application and issues permanent resident visas to successful applicants.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE RE: TECHNICAL ISSUE</strong></p>

<p>On August 16, 2017, the program was performing planned system testing.</p>

<p><strong>ONTARIO IMMIGRANT NOMINEE PROGRAM (OINP) ISSUES FRAUD WARNING</strong></p>

<p>Important: &nbsp;You will never receive a confirmation letter or nomination certificate from the OINP if you have not applied to the program and do not have an application pending.</p>

<p>Some members of the public have been receiving emails with a false Ontario Certificate of Nomination attached, requesting a “Right of Permanent Residence Fee” (RPRF).</p>

<p>These certificates bear the Government of Ontario Logo and the address of 400 University Avenue in Toronto.</p>

<p>This fraudulent activity can be identified through the following markers:</p>

<ul>
<li>No Certificate of Nomination will ever be emailed to you by the OINP.</li>

<li>The contact telephone and fax number on the certificate contain a 708 area code. This is not an area code used in Ontario and is not connected to the OINP in any way.</li>

<li>The false nomination certificate refers to the CIC Visa Office. The Federal Government of Canada has changed the name of the department that deals with Canadian immigration. It is now called Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).</li>

<li>You will never be asked to make a payment to the OINP through a wire transfer, and you will never be asked to pay a ‘Right of Permanent Residence Fee’. Applicants to the OINP pay a one-time upfront administration fee to the program, through the online system, and do not pay for a nomination certificate when and if it is granted.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to note that the OINP, as well as any other Canadian Immigration Program, will never contact you by phone or email to make a payment. If you receive such a call or email, please forward the information to the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program immediately at <a href="mailto:ProgramIntegrityTeam@ontario.ca">ProgramIntegrityTeam@ontario.ca</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Never give out personal information such as account numbers, mother’s maiden name, passwords or other identifying information in response to unsolicited emails or calls.</p>

<p>To report fraud, contact the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre by telephone at 1-888-495-8501 or through their website: <a href="http://www.antifraudcentre-centreanitfraude.ca/">http://www.antifraudcentre-centreanitfraude.ca</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Ontario’s Express Entry Human Capital Priorities Stream: Issuance of Notifications of Interest by Targeted Occupations</strong></p>

<p>The Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP) is an economic immigration program designed to help Ontario meet its labour market and economic development priorities.</p>

<p>The OINP continues to improve the program’s responsiveness to labour market and economic development needs and identify more candidates with experience in some of Ontario’s priority sectors and in demand occupations. As part of that vision, the program will begin issuing targeted Notifications of Interest (NOIs) to candidates who qualify for Ontario’s Express Entry Human Capital Priorities (HCP) Stream<em><strong> and </strong></em>who have work experience in specific occupations identified by the OINP.</p>

<p>For these occupation-specific searches only, the OINP will be lowering the required minimum Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score below 400. To qualify, candidates will need to meet all other HCP stream eligibility criteria (see below) and have skilled work experience in one of the targeted occupations.</p>

<p>All applicants to the HCP Stream must meet the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>&nbsp;<strong>Work Experience:</strong> A minimum of <strong>either</strong>: 

<ul>
<li><strong>one year</strong> work experience <strong>within the past five years</strong> according to the criteria under the <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/cec/apply-who.asp">Federal Skilled Workers Program</a>, or</li>

<li><strong>one year</strong> work experience <strong>within the past three years</strong> according to the criteria under the <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/cec/apply-who.asp">Canadian Experience Class</a>;</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Education: </strong>Equivalent of a Canadian Bachelor’s degree or above;</li>

<li><strong>Language:</strong> A minimum of Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) 7 in English or in French;</li>

<li><strong>Settlement Funds:</strong> A minimum level of savings or income in Ontario; and</li>

<li><strong>Intent:</strong> An intention to reside in Ontario long term.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>For the week of June 26, 2017</strong>, the OINP will be targeting candidates with work experience in the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector.</p>

<p>Please note that in addition to these occupation-specific searches, the OINP will continue regular searches of the Express Entry pool for candidates who qualify for the HCP Stream with a CRS score of 400 points or more. These candidates can demonstrate work experience in any National Occupational Classification (NOC) 0, A and B occupation as long as they have a CRS score of 400 or higher.</p>

<p>Prospective applicants to the HCP Stream are encouraged to create a new profile in the Express Entry system to make it easier for Ontario to identify their profile during its search in the federal government’s Express Entry pool. Please note that if you create a new Express Entry profile, you must delete your old profile. &nbsp;</p>

<p>To ensure processing efficiency and quality customer service, the OINP is monitoring the volume of applications to the HCP Stream and issuing NOIs periodically throughout the year until Ontario's 2017 federal nomination allocation is fulfilled. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Receiving a Notification of Interest does not mean you will be nominated under one of Ontario’s Express Entry streams. Please consult the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program website and review the requirements of the stream that interests you to ensure you meet both provincial and federal criteria.</p>

<p><strong>Deadlines for the HCP Stream:</strong></p>

<p>Your Notification of Interest (NOI) is valid for six months. This means that you must register a profile for the HCP Stream in the OINP e-Filing Portal within six months of receiving your NOI from Ontario.</p>

<p>Once you register a profile for the HCP Stream in the OINP e Filing Portal, you must submit your complete application to the OINP within 14 calendar days.</p>

<p>The 14 day deadline to apply following registration for the HCP Stream must not be confused with the validity period of your NOI from Ontario.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> An NOI does<strong> not </strong>guarantee you a registration in the OINP e Filing Portal. If you intend to apply for the HCP Stream, it is recommended that you register a profile and submit an application as soon as possible to ensure that your application is received before Ontario’s nomination allocation is fulfilled.</p>

<p>If you have questions about the requirements of the HCP Stream, you can visit the OINP’s <a href="http://www.ontarioimmigration.ca/en/pnp/OI_PNPQUESTIONS.html">Frequently Asked Questions page</a> or contact the OINP by email at <a href="mailto:ontarionominee@ontario.ca">ontarionominee@ontario.ca</a>.

<p><strong>Re: &nbsp;Launch of New Express Entry Skilled Trades Stream, Streamlined Employer Job Offer Stream and Updated Entrepreneur Stream</strong></p>

<p>The OINP has launched a new stream for skilled trades workers under the Express Entry system, and has streamlined its Employer Job Offer Stream and updated its Entrepreneur Stream.</p>

<p><strong>New: Ontario’s Express Entry Skilled Trades Stream</strong><br>
The new <a href="http://www.ontarioimmigration.ca/en/pnp/OI_PNPTRADES.html">Express Entry Skilled Trades Stream</a> &nbsp;is targeted at attracting skilled trades workers to meet labour market needs in the construction and agricultural sectors, but could be expanded to other sectors in the future. <a href="http://www.ontarioimmigration.ca/en/pnp/OI_PNPTRADES_APPLY.html">Applications</a> are now being accepted online for this stream.</p>

<p><strong>Streamlined Employer Job Offer Stream</strong><br>

Less documentation is required upfront from the employer. <a href="http://www.ontarioimmigration.ca/en/pnp/OI_PNPJOBOFFER.html">Applications</a> are now being accepted online for this stream.</p>

<p><strong>Updated Entrepreneur Stream</strong><br>
The minimum language level required for the <a href="http://www.ontarioimmigration.ca/en/pnp/OI_PNPENTREPRENEUR.html">Entrepreneur Stream</a> has been lowered, and potential applicants will receive more points on their Expression of Interest if they wish to establish their business, or buy an existing business, in a community outside the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). &nbsp;<a href="http://www.ontarioimmigration.ca/en/pnp/OI_PNPENTREPRENEUR_APPLY.html">Expressions of Interest </a>continue to be accepted online for this stream.</p>

<p><strong>ATTENTION:</strong><br>
The OINP is a very popular program and receives a significant number of applications. The ministry has taken comprehensive measures to help ensure applicants have a smooth user experience when accessing the OINP e-filing system. However, applicants may experience longer than anticipated wait times, as a large number of applicants attempt to access the system at the same time.</p>

<p>To support a smooth user experience, applicants:</p>

<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Should avoid opening multiple tabs or refreshing the page when trying to access the OINP e-filing system.</li>

<li>&nbsp;Must access the OINP e-filing system through OntarioImmigration.ca. Attempting to directly access the e-filing system through the Government of Ontario’s ONe-key system will cause delays, and could prevent applicants from completing their applications.</li>
</ul>

<p>Applicants will be queued upon entry to the e-filing system. &nbsp;If applicants attempt to refresh pages or click on links to other pages once they enter the e-filing system, they will lose their place in the queue. &nbsp;Applicants are encouraged to remain in the queue until the system is ready to proceed.</p>

<p>If you experience technical difficulties with your online application or the OINP e-filing system, visit our <a href="http://www.ontarioimmigration.ca/tipsheet">Tip Sheet</a> for solutions. &nbsp;If you are still having difficulties, please contact the OINP directly at: <a href="mailto:OINP.technical-POCI.technique@ontario.ca">OINP.technical-POCI.technique@ontario.ca</a>, and include as much detail as possible. &nbsp;Applicants should include a screen shot and details about how the error occurred. &nbsp;If applicants have successfully registered for an OINP stream, they should also include their case number for reference.</p>

<p>Applicants will have to access the e-filing application service through <a href="http://www.ontarioimmigration.ca/en/index.htm">OntarioImmigration.ca</a>.&nbsp; Attempting to directly access the e-filing system through the Government of Ontario’s ON<em>e-key </em>system will cause delays and prevent you from completing your application.</p>

<p>Applicants will be queued upon entry to the e-filing system.&nbsp; If applicants attempt to refresh the page or click on links to other pages once they enter the e-filing system, they will lose their place in the queue. Applicants are encouraged to remain in the queue until the system is ready to proceed.</p>

<p>Express Entry Human Capital Priorities Stream: Issuance of Notifications of Interest</p>

<p>The Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP) will resume issuing Notifications of Interest (NOIs) to applicants who qualify for Ontario’s Express Entry Human Capital Priorities (HCP) Stream the week of April 10-14, 2017.</p>

<p>Prospective applicants are encouraged to create a new profile in the Express Entry (EE) system to make it easier for Ontario to identify their profile during its search of the federal government’s Express Entry pool. &nbsp;Please note that if you create a new EE profile, you must delete your old profile. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Prospective applicants who meet the HCP Stream criteria, have a minimum Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score of 400, and are identified in the Express Entry pool will be sent a NOI.</p>

<p>The OINP is an economic immigration program designed to help Ontario meet its labour market and economic development priorities. For this round of NOIs, the program will also be targeting candidates in high-demand skilled trades in the construction sector who meet the criteria of the HCP stream. &nbsp;These occupations include: &nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Carpenters</li>

<li>Electricians (except industrial and power system)</li>

<li>Construction millwrights and industrial mechanics</li>

<li>Welders</li>

<li>Painters and decorators (except interior decorators)</li>

<li>Plumbers&nbsp;</li>

<li>Bricklayers</li>

<li>Roofers and shinglers</li>

<li>Sheet metal workers</li>

<li>Tilesetters</li>

<li>Boilermakers</li>

<li>Plasterers, drywall installers and finishers and lathers</li>

<li>Industrial electricians</li>
</ul>

<p>To ensure processing efficiency and quality customer service, the OINP is monitoring the volume of applications to the HCP Stream and issuing NOIs periodically throughout the year until Ontario's 2017 federal nomination allocation is fulfilled. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Deadlines for the HCP Stream</strong></p>

<p>Your Notification of Interest (NOI) is valid for six months. This means that you must register a profile for the HCP Stream in the OINP e-Filing Portal within six months of receiving your NOI from Ontario.</p>

<p>Once you register a profile for the HCP Stream in the OINP e Filing Portal, you must submit your complete application to the OINP within 14 calendar days.</p>

<p>The 14 day deadline to apply following registration for the HCP Stream must not be confused with the validity period of your NOI from Ontario.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<p>If you have questions about the requirements of the HCP Stream, you can visit our <a href="http://www.ontarioimmigration.ca/en/pnp/OI_PNPQUESTIONS.html">Questions and Answers page</a> or contact the OINP by email at <a href="mailto:ontarionominee@ontario.ca">ontarionominee@ontario.ca</a>.

<p><strong><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Update to the Reconsideration Process</span></strong><br>
<br>
The Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP) gives applicants an opportunity to seek a review or reconsideration of the refusal decision of their application. The reconsideration process is in place to provide applicants recourse to the refusal of their application should they feel an error was made by the program in its assessment.<br>
<br>
Effective <strong>March 10, 2017</strong>, the OINP will no longer accept written requests for reconsideration submitted by mail. Applicants will be required to send all <strong>requests for reconsideration by email to </strong><a href="mailto:reconsiderations@ontario.ca"><strong>reconsiderations@ontario.ca</strong></a><strong> within 30 calendar days</strong> of the date on their refusal letter. In the email, applicants must clearly identify what error(s) they believe was/were made in the assessment of their application. The error(s) identified must be related to the stated reason(s) for the refusal of their application.<br>
<br>
Please note that a reconsideration request will consider eligibility at the time of the original application. A decision will not be reconsidered on the basis of a change in circumstances after the application was submitted and will not take into consideration new information or documentation that was not submitted to the program during the initial application assessment. In these instances, applicants should submit a new application to the program. Applicants submitting a new application are required to pay the application fee for the new application.<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong>: Please be advised that the OINP will continue to accept and assess any requests for reconsideration received by March 10, 2017. Any requests received by mail <strong>after</strong> March 10, 2017 will be returned.<br>

<p><strong>Update to the Three Years of Active Business Requirement for Employer Applications</strong></p>

<p>Employers must demonstrate that they have been in <strong>active business</strong> (corporations, limited partnerships and sole proprietorships) for at least 3 years before submitting an application to the OINP. This includes recently amalgamated corporations who are able to demonstrate that:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>the business (including one of the predecessor businesses) has been in continuous operation for three years;</li>

<li>that the job-offers to potential nominees are still valid; and</li>

<li>that the restructuring does not affect the employment opportunities of Ontarians.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to demonstrate that they meet the above criteria, employers who have been amalgamated in the past three years are required to provide the following documents.</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>A written statement explaining the need for foreign workers if layoffs occurred as a result of the amalgamation.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the amalgamation took place prior to the submission of, or approval of, the employer application, the employer must provide:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Revenue Canada Schedules 125 (Income Statement Information) and 141 (Accounting Practitioner Information) <strong>OR</strong> the company’s financial statements signed by a certified accountant for the pre-amalgamated and post-amalgamated corporations covering the three years prior to the application being submitted.</li>

<li>Revenue Canada T4 Summary for the pre-merger and post-merger corporations covering the three years prior to the application being submitted</li>
</ul>

<p>If an amalgamation took place after an employer application is approved, the employer must also provide an updated job offer letter for each position. The new offer must match the key information that was approved by the program during the employer pre-screen application process. Specifically the position must:&nbsp;</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>be permanent and full time;</li>

<li>be the same National Occupational Classification (NOC) code as the previous offer;</li>

<li>offer the same wage or a higher wage as the previous offer; and</li>

<li>be for the same number of hours as the previous offer.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Please note</strong>: on May 9, 2016 the OINP temporarily paused intake of new pre-screen applications (see program update for May 9, 2016). The guidance above applies only to applications received by the Program prior to May 9, 2016.</p>

<p><strong><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">May 30, 2016<br>

<strong>IMPORTANT NOTIFICATION: Fraudulent Calls</strong></p>

<p><strong>Some members of the public have received fraudulent calls from an OINP phone number (416-327-0374) requesting payment of funds, and threatening deportation.&nbsp; These calls are not being made by OINP staff.&nbsp; This may be a case of Call ID </strong><a href="http://www.antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca/fraud-escroquerie/spoofing-falsification-eng.htm"><strong>spoofing</strong></a><strong> which is used by individuals to disguise their phone number to appear as someone else.</strong></p>

<p><strong>OINP never contacts clients by phone to collect funds.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Never give out personal information such as account numbers, social insurance number (SIN), mother's maiden name, passwords or other identifying information in response to unexpected calls.</strong></p>

<p><strong>OINP recommends that if you have concerns about the legitimacy of a call, you should ask for the name of the agent calling, and then email the OINP at </strong><a href="mailto:ontarionominee@ontario.ca"><strong>ontarionominee@ontario.ca</strong></a><strong> to confirm whether the call was genuine.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Anyone receiving a telephone call from an OINP phone number demanding payment should hang up immediately and contact their local police and notify OINP.&nbsp; You may also report the incident to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre by telephone at 1-888-495-8501 or through their website: </strong><a href="http://www.antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca/"><strong>http://www.antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca</strong></a></p>

<p><strong><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">May 9, 2016<br>

<strong>IMPORTANT NOTIFICATION</strong></p>

<p>As a result of changes Ontario has made to more closely align the streams of the program with the needs of its labour market, the province has already received the sufficient number of OINP applications to meet its 2016 federal allocation. This is further proof that Ontario remains a very sought after destination for highly-skilled workers.</p>

<p>Following the lead of other jurisdictions, Ontario has made the responsible decision to place a temporary pause on the intake of applications for select, high-volume OINP streams. Other provinces have also done this in the past after fully maximizing their allotments. It’s important to note that lower-volume streams of the OINP and other options continue to be available.</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Ontario stopped sending Notifications of Interest (NOIs) for the OINP Human Capital Priorities (Express Entry) stream effective February 16, 2016.</li>

<li>Ontario temporarily paused the intake of new applications for the following select, high-volume OINP streams effective 5 p.m. EDT on May 9, 2016: 

<ul type="circle">
<li>Employer Pre-screen</li>

<li>International Student – Masters src/main/resources/</li>

<li>International Student – PhD src/main/resources/</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>All applications for the Employer Pre-screen and International Students (Masters Graduate and PhD Graduate) streams sent after 5 p.m. EDT on May 9, 2016 will not be processed and will be returned to the applicant along with the unprocessed payment.</li>

<li>The OINP will continue to accept applications from Foreign Worker and International Student with a Job Offer applicants as Employer Pre-screen applications are assessed. Only those Foreign Worker and International Student with a Job Offer applicants <strong>whose job offer has been approved through the Employer Pre-screen application process </strong>may apply to the OINP<strong>.&nbsp; </strong>These applicants will have 60 days from the date of the Employer Pre-screen approval letter to apply to either of these streams.</li>

<li>The OINP continues to accept and process applications for the <a href="http://www.ontarioimmigration.ca/en/pnp/OI_PNP_EE_FRENCH.html">French-Speaking Skilled Worker stream</a> and the <a href="http://www.ontarioimmigration.ca/en/pnp/OI_PNPCORPORATE.html">Corporate stream</a>. The OINP also continues to accept Expressions of Interest for the <a href="http://www.ontarioimmigration.ca/en/pnp/OI_PNPENTREPRENEUR.html">Entrepreneur stream</a><u>.</u></li>

<li>Ontario remains a top destination for workers and their families from all over the world.</li>

<li>Ontario anticipates that it will receive its 2017 nomination allocation from the federal government before the end of November 2016, and the province expects to be in a position to accept applications for some streams in six months.</li>

<li>Given the positive effect of the program on Ontario’s economy, the province continues to engage the federal government on nominee numbers.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>There are many ways to immigrate to Ontario:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The federal government determines the maximum number of nominations Ontario can award annually. Each year, there are about 300,000 immigrants that come to Canada. Of these, Ontario is allowed to select 5,500 through the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP) in 2016. This program, which represents only 1.8 per cent of total immigration to Canada, is targeted towards filling labour market gaps with skilled workers. It is just one option for immigrating to Ontario.</li>

<li>Please visit the specific webpages for those streams that are still accepting applications or expressions of interest: <a href="http://www.ontarioimmigration.ca/en/pnp/OI_PNP_EE_FRENCH.html">French-Speaking Skilled Worker stream</a>, <a href="http://www.ontarioimmigration.ca/en/pnp/OI_PNPCORPORATE.html">Corporate stream</a> and <a href="http://www.ontarioimmigration.ca/en/pnp/OI_PNPENTREPRENEUR.html">Entrepreneur stream</a>.</li>

<li>In addition, other <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/eligibility.asp">options are available from the federal government</a>.</li>

<p><strong>Update to the Settlement Fund Requirement for Ontario Express Entry and Masters Graduates</strong></p>

<p>All applicants to the Masters src/main/resources/ and the Ontario Express Entry Streams (Human Capital Priorities and the French-Speaking Skilled Worker) must demonstrate that they have sufficient funds and/or income to cover settlement costs in Ontario for themselves and their dependant family members.&nbsp; For more information, please review the “Settlement Funds” section of the applicable guide.<br>
<br>
The Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP) determines settlement fund requirements based on the Low Income Cut-Offs (LICO) for different family sizes.&nbsp; These amounts are updated every year by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).&nbsp; You can find the new <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/funds.asp">LICO requirements here</a>.<br>
<br>
<strong>For applicants who have applied on or after May 6, 2016:</strong>&nbsp; please ensure that your application package contains supporting information which demonstrates you meet the new settlement funds requirement.<br>
<br>
<strong>For applicants who have submitted an application prior to May 6, 2016:&nbsp; </strong>your application will be evaluated against the settlement funds requirement that was in place at the time of application.&nbsp; That is, you will need to meet the LICO requirement of 2015. Please note that applicants of the Ontario Express Entry Streams may be refused by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) when they apply for permanent resident status if they do not meet the new 2016 LICO.</p>

<p><strong><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">March 4, 2016</span></strong></p>

<p><strong>Clarification: Wage Requirements</strong></p>

<p>The OINP expects that the employee will receive pay for hours worked according to the information provided by the employer. The OINP requires that an employer’s wage offer to a prospective nominee be described on the basis of the individual’s hourly wage expressed as either a) hourly pay and hours per year, or b) weekly pay and weeks per year. This allows the program to verify that prospective nominees will be appropriately remunerated.</p>

<p>Please note: The program does not consider remuneration by piece work, bonuses, commissions, vacation pay or non-financial compensation as comprising part of a prospective nominee’s offered wage. &nbsp;An employer may offer a prospective nominee piece work, bonuses, commissions, or non-financial compensation in addition to base pay. However, these will not be considered part of the prospective nominee’s hourly or weekly base pay. Additionally, the hourly or weekly base pay offered to the prospective nominee must meet or exceed the prevailing wage (for the Foreign Worker Stream) or entry-level wage (for the International Student with a Job Offer Stream) established by occupation and region on the <a href="http://www.jobbank.gc.ca/home-eng.do?lang=eng">federal government’s Job Bank website</a>.</p>

<p><strong>February 29, 2016</strong></p>

<p>The OINP collects credit card information to verify an applicant’s residency history and/or assess an applicant’s intention to settle in Ontario.<br>
<br>
This update provides guidelines on the submission of credit card information to the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP). &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Please note that documents containing sensitive credit card information must be redacted to be accepted by the OINP. To sufficiently redact the sensitive information from your credit card statement, please do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using a black marker, block out the entire cardholder account number on all pages of your credit card statements or other documents containing this information, if applicable.</li>

<li>Photocopy the document(s) after you have blocked out all appearances of the cardholder account number and security code, if applicable.</li>

<li>Submit the photocopied document(s) only, not the originals.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Applicants should not submit credit card statements unless they are specified to do so in the application guide/form or are otherwise requested to do so by program staff to support an application.&nbsp;</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Where the program requests supplemental financial information to support an application, applicants are asked to remove any credit card information prior to forwarding to OINP.&nbsp;<br>
</strong><br>
<strong>Please be advised that the OINP cannot accept redacted documents containing credit card information via email or fax.&nbsp; Redacted documents containing credit card information must be forwarded via mail/courier or dropped off in person at the OINP offices.&nbsp;</strong><br>
<br>
Effective March 30th, 2016, application submissions that contain documents with credit card information that lack sufficient redaction will be returned to applicants as incomplete submissions because these documents cannot be accepted by OINP.</p>

<p><strong>Entrepreneur Stream Criteria Clarification – Updated Guide&nbsp;</strong><br>
<br>
The Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP) Entrepreneur Stream Guide has been updated to clarify the minimum business experience requirement.<br>
<br>
Entrepreneurs and their business partner (if applicable) are <strong>required to have a minimum of 36 months of full-time business experience in the last 60 months.</strong> Entrepreneurs and their business partner are <strong>not required</strong> to have spent the last 12 months in either active general business administration or in an area of expertise related to the proposed business opportunity provided they meet the minimum requirement of 36 months in the last 60 months of full-time business experience.<br>
<br>
This clarification has no impact on the Expression of Interest (EOI) submission process. EOIs already submitted will not be impacted. Please note that meeting the minimum business experience requirement, or other minimum requirements, does not guarantee that you will receive an invitation to apply to the Entrepreneur Stream.<br>
<br>
The updated OINP Entrepreneur Stream Guide can be found <a href="http://www.ontarioimmigration.ca/prodconsum/groups/csc/@oipp/documents/document/oi_en_entre.pdf">here</a> and is effective immediately.&nbsp;<br>

<p>Express Entry is an Immigration, Refugee, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) application management system to manage permanent resident applications for skilled migration to Canada.<br>
<br>
Ontario uses Express Entry (EE) to select potential nominees for permanent residence under two Ontario Express Entry Streams.<br>
<br>
It has come to our attention that technical issues may have resulted in candidates not receiving Notification of Interest (NOI) though they believe they meet the criteria for Ontario’s Express Entry streams. If you believe you fall into this category and have not received an NOI within one month of submitting your EE profile, we encourage you to create a new profile in the EE system. If you create a new EE profile, you must delete your old profile.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions about your EE profile please contact Immigration, Refugee, and Citizenship Canada.</p>

<p><strong><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Program Update: Temporary pause on OINP “base” stream applications</span></strong><br>
<br>
Annual provincial nomination targets are determined by the Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC). The Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP) received a base stream allocation of 2,500 nominations for 2015.<br>
<br>
OINP has exhausted its base stream allocation for 2015, and the program is unable to issue further nominations under its base streams until January 4, 2016. If you have already submitted an application to the OINP but have not yet received a decision, your application will be finalized in 2016.<br>
<br>
If your employer pre-screen application has been approved, the OINP will continue to accept the corresponding nominee application(s) under the Foreign Worker and International Student with a Job Offer streams.<br>
<br>
Between November 16th, 2015 and January 3, 2016, the program will not accept any new Employer pre-screen applications or applications under the Master’s and PhD streams. Any applications received during this time period will be returned to the applicant. The program welcomes new applications under these streams starting on January 4, 2016.<br>

<p>Due to Federal level changes to the issuance of temporary work permits, as of June 20th, 2015, OINP no longer has the authority to issue support letters for open work permits. <strong><em>This only applies to nominees in streams under the </em></strong><a href="http://www.ontarioimmigration.ca/en/pnp/OI_PNPCAPITAL.html"><strong><em>Human Capital Category</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong>and includes all streams that do not require a job offer.To learn about your options for retaining legal status in Canada, see CIC’s website for information about <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/tools/temp/work/prov/bridging.asp">Bridging Open Work Permit eligibility requirements.</a></p>

<p>All Ontario nominees with a job offer may still qualify for a <a href="http://www.ontarioimmigration.ca/en/pnp/OI_PNPNOMINEES.html">temporary work permit</a>, and Ontario will continue to support temporary work permit applications of nominees. &nbsp;Please note that a provincial nomination does not guarantee approval of a temporary work permit application, as CIC is responsible for the issuance of temporary work permits.</p>

<p><strong><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">June 10, 2015</span></strong></p>

<p><strong>Effective June 25, 2015</strong>, Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP) will update its application guides and forms.

<p><strong><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">February 4, 2015</span></strong></p>

<p>Every year, Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program's nomination target is capped by Citizenship and Immigration Canada. Ontario’s allocation for 2015 has been set at 5,200. This includes nominations for both PNP and Express Entry.</p>

<p>Ontario is currently developing its approach to Express Entry. Information will be posted on our website as soon as it becomes available.</p>

<p><strong><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">December 29, 2014</span></strong></p>

<p>Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP) has updated its minimum language requirements for International Students: Masters src/main/resources/ for the 2015 nomination year.</p>

<p>Previously, applicants under the International Students: Masters src/main/resources/ were required to demonstrate language proficiency in English with a minimum overall score of 7 or higher in the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) General Test, or in French with a minimum overall score of 5 or higher in the Test d’Évaluation de Français (TEF).</p>

<p><strong>New Requirements</strong></p>

<p>Effective February 1st, 2015 for the 2015 nomination year, International Masters Graduates will be required to demonstrate official language proficiency equivalent to the Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) 7 for <strong>each</strong> language competency (i.e. listening, reading, writing and speaking).</p>

<p>Applicants will be required to have the following minimum scores in each of the language competency:</p>

<ul>
<li>Listening: IELTS 6 or TEF 249-279</li>

<li>Reading: IELTS 6 or TEF 207-232</li>

<li>Writing: IELTS 6 or TEF 310-348</li>

<li>Speaking: IELTS 6 or TEF 310-348</li>
</ul>

<p>This new scoring methodology offers a fairer and more transparent process for applicants.</p>

<p>Note that IELTS or TEF tests will still need to be taken within 12 months of application submission.</p>

<p><strong>Frequently Asked Question</strong></p>

<p><em>What if I already submitted my application?</em></p>

<p>Applications received by Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program prior to February 1st, 2015 will be assessed using the previous minimum language requirements. Applications received after this date will be assessed using the new requirements. <strong>Applicants are responsible for ensuring that their application is received by January 30th, 2015 if they are applying under the previous minimum language requirements.</strong></p>

<p><strong><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">October 31, 2014</span></strong></p>

<p>Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP) has met its 2014 target of 2,500 nominations. Applicants can still submit their applications under all streams. However, because the nomination target has been reached, Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program is unable to issue nominations for the remainder of 2014.</p>

<p>Nominee applications that have been received but have not been finalized in 2014 will automatically be placed in priority for finalization in 2015. Any application received after October 31, 2014 will be assessed as part of the 2015 nomination target.</p>

<p>Annual provincial nomination targets are determined by the Federal Government, Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC).</p>

<p>Please continue to check this website for updates.</p>

<p><strong><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Effective August 1, 2014</span></strong></p>

<p>Effective August 1, 2014, Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) is changing the definition of a dependent child for immigration programs (including the Provincial Nominee Program class). Children will be considered a dependent if they are under the age of 19. No exceptions will be made for children who are full-time students.</p>

<p>In all cases, a child with a mental or physical condition will continue to be considered a dependant, regardless of age, if they depend on their parents for financial support.</p>

<p>All permanent resident applications received by CIC and all PNP applications received by the province before August 1, 2014 will continue to benefit from the pre-amendment definition of dependent child. Please note that a complete application has to be received before August 1, 2014. Applications postmarked on July 31, 2014 or earlier, but not received until August 1, 2014 or later will be subject to the new definition.</p>

<p>In addition, as of August 1, 2014, a child’s age will be recorded as when the application is first submitted to the province. If they are eligible at this time, they will remain eligible throughout the application process.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Step 1: An applicant with a child aged 18 applies to The Provincial Nominee Program (PNP).</p>

<p>Step 2: The applicant is assessed and nominated by the province for permanent residence (PR).</p>

<p>Step 3: The applicant consequently gathers required documents and submits his/her PR application to CIC, but their child is now over 19 years old. CIC would accept the age of the child on the date of the PNP application (locked in date).</p>

<p>More information on the impact of the change to the definition of dependent child is available on <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/index.asp">CIC's website</a> as of August 1, 2014.</p>

<p><strong><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">July 23, 2013</span></strong></p>

<p>Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program recently updated some of its applications forms. Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program is moving towards having all of its application forms in a PDF format. This move will eliminate confusion by having one single format for all program forms and ease client experience, as the PDF forms are now in a saveable format. Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program will no longer accept application forms in a Microsoft Word format.</p>

<li>Pre-Screen Application for Previously Approved Employers</li>

<li>Nominee Application for International Graduates (PhD and Masters)</li>

<li>Nominee Application with Job Offer</li>
</ol>

<p>Please note that there are no changes to program criteria or documentation. However, Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program updated employer forms to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Clarify requirements around local recruitment efforts, and</li>

<li>Ask employers to identify their sector of activity using the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).</li>
</ol>

<p>To view and download the updated forms, please visit the <a href="http://www.ontarioimmigration.ca/en/pnp/OI_PNPFORMS.html">forms and guides</a> page of Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program.</p>

<p>Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program will continue to accept old forms until the end of August 2013. Beginning September 1, 2013 applicants are required to submit the new forms, otherwise forms may be returned to the sender.</p>

<p><strong><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">June 20, 2013</span></strong></p>

<p>Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP) has successfully met its 2012 target of 1,100 nominations.</p>

<p>The nominations target for 2013 is 1,300 for all streams of the program. Please visit our website for any updates.</p>

<p>Annual provincial nomination targets are determined by the federal government, Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC).</p>

<p><strong><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">November 23, 2012</span></strong></p>

<p>As of November 5, 2012, Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program is able to issue support letters for open work permits for skilled workers nominated by the program under the Federal Skilled Workers Backlog Reduction Pilot (FSW Pilot).</p>

<p>The support letters for open work permits will be issued to all nominees nominated under the FSW Pilot. The letters will allow FSW Pilot nominees to apply for an Ontario specific open work permit with a validity of up to two years. The open work permit will allow FSW Pilot nominees to come to Ontario faster and start working in the province before they receive their Permanent Resident status.</p>

<p>Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program will make this letter of support available to all FSW Pilot nominees and will be mailing packages in the next two months.</p>

<p>For more information about the open work permit, please visit the <a href="http://www.ontarioimmigration.ca/en/pnp/OI_PNPNOMINEES.html">Nominees – What’s Next section</a>.</p>

<p><strong><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">July 23, 2012</span></strong></p>

<p>Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program is now able to issue support letters for open work permits for international students nominated by the program under the PhD or Masters graduates without job offer streams.</p>

<p>The support letters for open work permits will be issued to provide assistance to certain graduates who require a means of maintaining or establishing status in Canada while they transition to Permanent Residence (PR) in Ontario. An open work permit issued by Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) would provide a bridge from student to worker for those nominees whose temporary authorization to remain in Canada following graduation would expire between the province’s nomination and the anticipated finalization of the student’s PR application. Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program will use its R204(c) authority under the Canada-Ontario Immigration Agreement and its Temporary Foreign Worker (TFW) Annex to facilitate the issuance of open work permits.</p>

<p>International students are expected to apply for a Post Graduate Work Permit (PGWP) to obtain temporary authorization to remain in Ontario. Only when PGWP avenue does not provide sufficient authorization to bridge an international student nominee to PR will Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program issue an open work permit.</p>

<p>For more information about the eligibility for the open work permit, please visit the <a href="http://www.ontarioimmigration.ca/en/pnp/OI_PNPNOMINEES.html">Nominees – What’s Next section</a>.</p>

<p><strong><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">March 29, 2012</span></strong></p>

<p>To get more skilled workers into Ontario faster, the province is working with the federal government to help reduce the backlog under the Federal Skilled Workers Program through the FSW Backlog Reduction Pilot (FSW Pilot).</p>

<p>Ontario is assisting with this backlog by nominating up to 600 additional foreign workers this year (2012). This is a separate component to the existing Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP) (Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program). Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program’s nominations cap of 1,000 for 2012 will remain for the other parts of the program.</p>

<p>CIC has issued letters to all potential applicants, inviting them to apply to Ontario’s FSW Pilot. Please note that only individuals who received this letter may apply to Ontario’s FSW Pilot. Applicants will have until May 4, 2012, to submit an application to Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program.</p>

<p><strong><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">December 1, 2011</span></strong></p>

<p>Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) has changed how it processes permanent residence applications submitted by provincial nominees.</p>

<p>Effective December 1, 2011, all provincial nominees must submit their permanent residence applications to CIC's Centralized Intake Office (CIO) in Sydney, Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>To allow for a transition period, CIC will continue to accept applications at visa offices until March 31, 2012. After March 31, 2012 Ontario nominees must submit their permanent residence applications to CIO in Sydney, Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program has updated the approval package we send to provincial nominees, as of December 1st, to reflect the changes to CIC's processes.</p>

<p>For more details on this new federal government process Ontario’s provincial nominees can visit CIC’s <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/provincial/apply-application.asp">website</a> or <a href="http://www.ontarioimmigration.ca/en/pnp/OI_PNPCONTACT.html">contact our office</a>.

<p>After October 28, 2011, Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program will only accept applications from persons represented by members in good standing of the ICCRC.</p>

<p><strong><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">May 27, 2011</span></strong></p>

<p>Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program has updated application forms, which gather additional information that is most commonly requested during processing of the application and will therefore improve processing.</p>

<ul>

<li>Form 152 - Joint Verification Form</li>

<li>Form 178 - Pre-Screen Application Form for Previously Approved Employers</li>
